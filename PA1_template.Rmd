## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r load_data}
raw <- read.csv('activity.csv') %>% mutate(date = as.POSIXct(date, "%Y-%m-$d"))
```
Please note that the packages loaded for this assignment were tidyverse, formattable, zoo, and ggplot2. 


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r steps_per_day}
steps_per_day <- raw %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(steps_per_day = sum(steps, na.rm = T))

ggplot(data = steps_per_day, aes(x = steps_per_day)) + geom_histogram(fill = 'blue',color = 'blue', bins = 15, alpha = 0.7) + labs(title = 'Histogram of the number of steps taken per day', y = 'Frequency', x = 'Daily steps')

paste0('The average number of steps taken per day is ',comma(mean(steps_per_day$steps_per_day),1),'.')

paste0('The median number of steps taken per day is ',comma(median(steps_per_day$steps_per_day),0),'.')

```




## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r daily_pattern}
daily_pattern <- raw %>% group_by(interval) %>% summarise(mean_per_interval = mean(steps, na.rm = T))

ggplot(data = daily_pattern, aes(x = interval, y = mean_per_interval)) + geom_line(color = 'red', size =1) + labs(title = 'Average steps per daily interval', x = 'interval', y = 'steps')

```




## Imputing missing values
```{r missing_data}
paste0('There are ',nrow(raw) - nrow(raw %>% filter_all(~!is.na(.))),' rows with missing data.')
```
```{r imputed_set}
imputed <- raw %>% group_by(interval) %>% mutate_at(vars(steps), ~na.aggregate(.))
head(imputed)

```

```{r hist_imputed_set}

imputed_steps_per_day <- imputed %>% group_by(date) %>% summarise(imputed_steps_per_day = sum(steps, na.rm = T))

ggplot(data = imputed_steps_per_day, aes(x = imputed_steps_per_day)) + geom_histogram(fill = 'red',color = 'red', bins = 15, alpha = 0.7) + labs(title = 'Histogram of the number of steps taken per day',subtitle = 'No missing values', y = 'Frequency', x = 'Daily steps')

paste0('The average number of steps taken per day is after imputing missing values is ',comma(mean(imputed_steps_per_day$imputed_steps_per_day),1),' while the unimputed average was ',comma(mean(steps_per_day$steps_per_day),1),'. This represents a difference of ',abs(comma(mean(steps_per_day$steps_per_day),1)-comma(mean(imputed_steps_per_day$imputed_steps_per_day),1)),' steps.')

paste0('The median number of steps taken per day is after imputing missing values is ',comma(median(imputed_steps_per_day$imputed_steps_per_day),1),' while the unimputed median was ',comma(median(steps_per_day$steps_per_day),1),'. This represents a difference of ',abs(comma(median(steps_per_day$steps_per_day),1)-comma(median(imputed_steps_per_day$imputed_steps_per_day),1)),' steps.')

paste0('Since the mean and median approached themselves after imputation, the resulting distribution is therefore less skewed (in fact not skewed at all since mean = median) than the raw set).')

```



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
```{r weekend}
weekend <- suppressWarnings(imputed %>% mutate(weekday = weekdays(date),weekend = as.factor(ifelse(weekday %in% c('Saturday','Sunday'), 'weekend', 'weekday')))) %>% group_by(interval,weekend) %>% summarise(mean_per_interval = mean(steps, na.rm = T))

ggplot(data = weekend) + geom_line(aes(x = interval, y = mean_per_interval, color = weekend), show.legend = F, size = 1.1) + facet_wrap(~weekend) + labs(title = 'Average steps per daily interval, weekend vs weekday', x = 'interval', y = 'steps')
```
